# web-scraper-top-250-movies
This is my first web scrapper ever! Just wanted to download important information regarding the top 250 movies worldwide. I'm sure some moviegoers will love it..

This is another project on my path as a data scientist. In this case I wanted to create a Web Scraper that allows downloading important information about the best 250 movies to date.

* Name of the movie
* Actors and directors
* IMDB Rating
* Release year
* Number of qualifiers
* Summary

I know there are ways to make a more efficient scraper, I'm learning, maybe in the future I'll be able to create a v2.
